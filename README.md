This project will attack according to data received from a function that finds all IPs in a network (e.g., 176.182.2.1-10) within a certain range. When the IPs in this range run out (176.182.2.11-20), it will attack those between 11 and 20, reaching a certain limit. to go until. This attacked IP will be attacked based on data coming from a function within a certain range of open port numbers (e.g. 1-256). When these ports are finished, the ports between 257-512 will be found and these ports will be searched intermittently until a certain limit is reached. This DFA and the program allows attacking the desired IP address range according to the incoming data.
